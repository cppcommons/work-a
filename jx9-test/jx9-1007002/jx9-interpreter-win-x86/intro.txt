Introduction
-------------------------

The Jx9 interpreter is a simple, basic standalone Jx9 interpreter that allows
the user to enter and execute Jx9 files against a Jx9 engine. 
To start the jx9 program, just type "jx9" followed by the name of the Jx9 file
to compile and execute. That is, the first argument is to the interpreter, the rest
are scripts arguments, press "Enter" and the Jx9 code will be executed.
If something goes wrong while processing the Jx9 script due to a compile-time
error, your error output (STDOUT) should display the compile-time error messages.

Usage example of the jx9 interpreter:

Running the interpreter
jx9 scripts/hello_world.jx9.txt
Running the interpreter with script arguments
jx9 scripts/mp3_tag.jx9.txt /usr/local/path/to/my_mp3s

The Jx9 interpreter package includes more than 40 Jx9 scripts to test ranging
from simple hello world programs to ZIP archive extracting, MP3 tag 
extracting, JSON encoding/decoding, INI processing, UTF-8 encoding/decoding
and many more. These scripts are available in the scripts directory
of the zip archive.

 Compile from source
------------------------

To compile the Jx9 interpreter from source, you need the latest release of Jx9
from http://jx9.symisc.net/downloads.html
After that, invoke your favourite compiler and generate the executable as follows:
     gcc -W -Wall -O6 -o jx9 jx9_interp.c jx9.c -D JX9_ENABLE_MATH_FUNC -lm
Don't forget to compile Jx9 with built-in math function [i.e: sqrt(), abs(), etc.]
using the JX9_ENABLE_MATH_FUNC compile-time directive.
Finally, don't forget to compile with full optimizations enabled.
